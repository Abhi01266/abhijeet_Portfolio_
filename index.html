        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
I am a dynamic professional with a background in Mechanical Engineering and a strong foundation in IT skills. Having successfully graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, I pivoted towards technology, completing intensive training in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and DevOps. Over the past 5 months, I've gained hands-on experience in a myriad of AWS and DevOps tools, including Git, Ansible, Jenkins CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes. This journey has not only equipped me with theoretical knowledge but also practical insights through active involvement in real-time projects. My unique blend of engineering and IT expertise positions me as a versatile individual ready to contribute effectively to innovative and collaborative projects in the ever-evolving landscape of technology..</p>

GitHub Integration using AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and
GitHub Webhook </h3>
                <p>automated CI/CD pipeline that seamlessly integrates GitHub, AWS services, Docker containers, Jenkins automation, and GitHub webhooks.The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the application using Docker containers and integrates GitHub webhooks for automated triggering.

Tools Used :-
1. Jenkins :- Configured Jenkins jobs for different stages of the pipeline, including building, testing, and deploying.
2. CI/CD Pipeline :- 
 automates the stages - Code, Build, Test and Deploy.
3.Github :-
 Utilized GitHub as the version control repository to host the project's source code.
4. AWS Services :- 
 Used AWS services such as Amazon EC2 Instance for hosting.
5. Docker :-
 Containerized the application using Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
 6. GitHub Webhook :-
 Integrated GitHub webhook to trigger the Jenkins pipeline for specific events (e.g., code pushes, pull requests).
Ensured automatic pipeline execution whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.automated CI/CD pipeline that seamlessly integrates GitHub, AWS services, Docker containers, Jenkins automation, and GitHub webhooks.The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the application using Docker containers and integrates GitHub webhooks for automated triggering.
